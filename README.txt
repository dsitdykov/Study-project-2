This was my coursework for the third semester at the university. The requirements were to use a circular doubly linked list algorithm and code a given game using a coding language of my choice.

It is a card game where you (cat) play against a computer (dog) on a web platform. This project was coded in HTML/CSS/JS. This game needs to be opened on live-server.

- There is one problem with this game, after all cards have been used, a new deck is generated, but after that, the code crashes and it is no longer playable.
